## why?

Why would you make a website totally unprofessional with these gimmicks you ask?
While organizing [UX Day Graz 2017](https://uxdaygraz2017.isds.tugraz.at/)
I had an opportunity to attend the [talk of Vitaly Friedman](https://youtu.be/MWYhMfaxXcQ?t=632).
I really liked the part where he points out the lack of character in most
modern websites. He continues to show that websites with a lot of character
which break best practice guidelines and design rules are able to capture
audience better and produce better results (turnover, traffic, user retention,
etc.).

This stuck with me so I decided to put all of my ideas for quirky websites
in a reusable package. Enter quirky-ux.
